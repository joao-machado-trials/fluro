# fluro

Hi, time to finish this task.
My apologies for not making it better, there are things to improve on "meal deal", but with time i would have solved it.
It has been a busy week unfortunately.

# run the app

Its easy, clone the github repository and open it in  IntelliJ Idea.
Run it and you will have a browser link on localhost:8080.
You can make buys from the "Add to Shopping Cart" button.

Check the mathematics.

Every time you set the pricing and specials, the order list will be reset for new calculations.
This could be done differently, but i chose that.

There are fields on specials that i defined to work for the specials on text. They are easy to 
maneuver and understand, they run the logic for the specials in text. You will get the feel on those.


The app is built with best practices as far as i can tell, i just needed more time.

Its built in Kotlin, as per requirement.


I point out also that the special Meal Deal is not working as it should be, but i assume the mistake is mine and would have fixed it had again more time, my apologies, its just bad calculations.

Would love to have a chance with Fluro. Thank you.
